# Tibetan Abbreviations
This repository contains a table of Tibetan abbreviations found in sources being explored by the ERC project The Dawn of Tibetan Buddhist Scholasticism (11th-13th c.) (TibSchol). Cf. https://www.oeaw.ac.at/projects/tibschol for more information. 

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 101001002). See https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001002.

The table was compiled by [Rachael Griffiths](https://github.com/rgriffiths1) and will be updated over the course of the project.

# Notes
The table was arranged using the [Python port of BDRC's JS Library](https://github.com/Esukhia/tibetan-sort-python). For more on sorting Tibetan in alphabetical order, see [this](https://www.bdrc.io/blog/2022/03/30/sorting-out-tibetan-alphabetical-order/?lang=bo) post by [Élie Roux](https://github.com/eroux).

Column 1 and 2 present the abbreviations to the degree it is possible using the [Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme](https://www.thlib.org/reference/transliteration/#!essay=/thl/ewts/intro/) (EWTS) and existing Tibetan Unicode.
